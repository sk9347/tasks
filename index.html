<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 60px;color: blueviolet;">RICH DAD POOR DAD</p>
<p><u> two dads offered me the choice of contrasting points of
view: one of a rich man and one of a poor man.
I had two fathers, a rich one and a poor one. One was highly educated
and intelligent. He had a Ph.D. and completed four years of undergraduate
work in less than two years. He then went on to Stanford University, the
University of Chicago, and Northwestern University to do his advanced
studies, all on full financial scholarships. The other father never finished the
eighth grade.</u>
Both men were successful in their careers, working hard all their lives.
Both earned substantial incomes. Yet one always struggled financially. The
other would become one of the richest men in Hawaii. One died leaving
tens of millions of dollars to his family, charities, and his church. The other
left bills to be paid.
Both men were strong, charismatic, and influential. Both men offered
me advice, but they did not advise the same things. Both men believed
strongly in education but did not recommend the same course of study.
If I had only one dad, I would have had to accept or reject his advice.
Having two dads offered me the choice of contrasting points of view: one of
a rich man and one of a poor man.
Instead of simply accepting or rejecting one or the other, I found myself
thinking more, comparing, and then choosing for myself. The problem was
that the rich man was not rich yet, and the poor man was not yet poor. Both
were just starting out on their careers, and both were struggling with money
and families. But they had very different points of view about money.
For example, one dad would say, “The love of money is the root of all
evil.” The other said, “The lack of money is the root of all evil.”
As a young boy, having two strong fathers both influencing me was
difficult. I wanted to be a good son and listen, but the two fathers did not
say the same things. The contrast in their points of view, particularly about
money, was so extreme that I grew curious and intrigued. I began to start
thinking for long periods of time about what each was saying.
Much of my private time was spent reflecting, asking myself questions
such as, “Why does he say that?” and then asking the same question of the
other dad’s statement. It would have been much easier to simply say, “Yeah,
he’s right. I agree with that.” Or to simply reject the point of view by
saying, “The old man doesn’t know what he’s talking about.” Instead,
having two dads whom I loved forced me to think and ultimately choose a
way of thinking for myself. As a process, choosing for myself turned out to
be much more valuable in the long run than simply accepting or rejecting a
single point of view.
One of the reasons the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the
middle class struggles in debt is that the subject of money is taught at home,
not in school. Most of us learn about money from our parents. So what can
poor parents tell their child about money? They simply say, “Stay in school
and study hard.” The child may graduate with excellent grades, but with a
poor person’s financial programming and mindset.
Sadly, money is not taught in schools. Schools focus on scholastic and
professional skills, but not on financial skills. This explains how smart
bankers, doctors, and accountants who earned excellent grades may struggle
financially all of their lives. Our staggering national debt is due in large part
to highly educated politicians and government officials making financial
decisions with little or no training in the subject of money.
Today I often wonder what will soon happen when we have millions of
people who need financial and medical assistance. They will be dependent
upon their families or the government for financial support. What will
happen when Medicare and Social Security run out of money? How will a
nation survive if teaching children about money continues to be left to
parents—most of whom will be, or already are, poor?
Because I had two influential fathers, I learned from both of them. I had
to think about each dad’s advice, and in doing so, I gained valuable insight
into the power and effect of one’s thoughts on one’s life. For example, one
dad had a habit of saying, “I can’t afford it.” The other dad forbade those
words to be used. He insisted I ask, “How can I afford it?” One is a
statement, and the other is a question. One lets you off the hook, and the
other forces you to think. My soon-to-be-rich dad would explain that by
automatically saying the words “I can’t afford it,” your brain stops working.
By asking the question “How can I afford it?” your brain is put to work. He
did not mean that you should buy everything you want. He was fanatical
about exercising your mind, the most powerful computer in the world. He’d
say, “My brain gets stronger every day because I exercise it. The stronger it
gets, the more money I can make.” He believed that automatically saying “I
can’t afford it” was a sign of mental laziness.
Although both dads worked hard, I noticed that one dad had a habit of
putting his brain to sleep when it came to finances, and the other had a habit
of exercising his brain. The long-term result was that one dad grew stronger
financially, and the other grew weaker. It is not much different from a
person who goes to the gym to exercise on a regular basis versus someone
who sits on the couch watching television. Proper physical exercise
increases your chances for health, and proper mental exercise increases
your chances for wealth.
My two dads had opposing attitudes and that affected the way they
thought. One dad thought that the rich should pay more in taxes to take care
of those less fortunate. The other said, “Taxes punish those who produce
and reward those who don’t produce.”
One dad recommended, “Study hard so you can find a good company to
work for.” The other recommended, “Study hard so you can find a good
company to buy.”
One dad said, “The reason I’m not rich is because I have you kids.” The
other said, “The reason I must be rich is because I have you kids.”
One encouraged talking about money and business at the dinner table,
while the other forbade the subject of money to be discussed over a meal.
One said, “When it comes to money, play it safe. Don’t take risks.” The
other said, “Learn to manage risk.”
One believed, “Our home is our largest investment and our greatest
asset.” The other believed, “My house is a liability, and if your house is
your largest investment, you’re in trouble.”
Both dads paid their bills on time, yet one paid his bills first while the
other paid his bills last.
One dad believed in a company or the government taking care of you
and your needs. He was always concerned about pay raises, retirement
plans, medical benefits, sick leave, vacation days, and other perks. He was
impressed with two of his uncles who joined the military and earned a
retirement-and-entitlement package for life after twenty years of active
service. He loved the idea of medical benefits and PX privileges the
military provided its retirees. He also loved the tenure system available
through the university. The idea of job protection for life and job benefits
seemed more important, at times, than the job. He would often say, “I’ve
worked hard for the government, and I’m entitled to these benefits.”
The other believed in total financial self-reliance. He spoke out against
the entitlement mentality and how it created weak and financially needy
people. He was emphatic about being financially competent.
One dad struggled to save a few dollars. The other created investments.
One dad taught me how to write an impressive resumé so I could find a
good job. The other taught me how to write strong business and financial
plans so I could create jobs.
Being a product of two strong dads allowed me the luxury of observing
the effects different thoughts have on one’s life. I noticed that people really
do shape their lives through their thoughts.
For example, my poor dad always said, “I’ll never be rich.” And that
prophecy became reality. My rich dad, on the other hand, always referred to
himself as rich. He would say things like, “I’m a rich man, and rich people
don’t do this.” Even when he was flat broke after a major financial setback,
he continued to refer to himself as a rich man. He would cover himself by
saying, “There is a difference between being poor and being broke. Broke is
temporary. Poor is eternal.”
My poor dad would say, “I’m not interested in money,” or “Money
doesn’t matter.” My rich dad always said, “Money is power.”
The power of our thoughts may never be measured or appreciated, but it
became obvious to me as a young boy that it was important to be aware of
my thoughts and how I expressed myself. I noticed that my poor dad was
poor, not because of the amount of money he earned, which was significant,
but because of his thoughts and actions. As a young boy having two fathers,
I became acutely aware of being careful about which thoughts I chose to
adopt as my own. Should I listen to my rich dad or to my poor dad?
There is a difference between being poor and being broke. Broke
is temporary. Poor is eternal.
Although both men had tremendous respect for education and learning,
they disagreed about what they thought was important to learn. One wanted
me to study hard, earn a degree, and get a good job to earn money. He
wanted me to study to become a professional, an attorney or an accountant,
and to go to business school for my MBA. The other encouraged me to
study to be rich, to understand how money works, and to learn how to have
it work for me. “I don’t work for money!” were words he would repeat over
and over. “Money works for me!”
At the age of nine, I decided to listen to and learn from my rich dad
about money. In doing so, I chose not to listen to my poor dad, even though
he was the one with all the college degrees.
A Lesson from Robert Frost
Robert Frost is my favorite poet. Although I love many of his poems, my
favorite is “The Road Not Taken.” I use its lesson almost daily.
The Road Not Taken
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads onto way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence;
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
And that has made all the difference.
Over the years, I have often reflected upon Robert Frost’s poem.
Choosing not to listen to my highly educated dad’s advice and attitude
about money was a painful decision, but it was a decision that shaped the
rest of my life.
Once I made up my mind about whom to listen to, my education about
money began. My rich dad taught me over a period of 30 years until I was
39 years old. He stopped once he realized that I knew and fully understood
what he had been trying to drum into my often-thick skull.
Money is one form of power. But what is more powerful is financial
education. Money comes and goes, but if you have the education about how
money works, you gain power over it and can begin building wealth. The
reason positive thinking alone does not work is because most people went
to school and never learned how money works, so they spend their lives
working for money.
Because I was only nine years old when I started, the lessons my rich
dad taught me were simple. And when it was all said and done, there were
only six main lessons, repeated over 30 years. This book is about those six
lessons, put as simply as possible, just as simply as my rich dad put forth
those lessons to me. The lessons are meant not to be answers, but
guideposts that will assist you and your children to grow wealthier no
matter what happens in a world of increasing change and uncertainty.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 60px;color: blueviolet;">LESSON 1: THE RICH DON’T WORK
FOR MONEY</p>
<p>The poor and the middle class work for money. The rich have
money work for them.
<b>“Dad, can you tell me how to get rich?”
My dad put down the evening paper. “Why do you want to get rich,
Son?”</b>
“Because today Jimmy’s mom drove up in their new Cadillac, and they
were going to their beach house for the weekend. He took three of his
friends, but Mike and I weren’t invited. They told us we weren’t invited
because we were poor kids.”
“They did?” my dad asked incredulously.
“Yeah, they did,” I replied in a hurt tone.
My dad silently shook his head, pushed his glasses up the bridge of his
nose, and went back to reading the paper. I stood waiting for an answer.
The year was 1956. I was nine years old. By some twist of fate, I
attended the same public school where the rich people sent their kids. We
were primarily a sugar-plantation town. The managers of the plantation and
the other affluent people, such as doctors, business owners, and bankers,
sent their children to this elementary school. After grade six, their children
were generally sent off to private schools. Because my family lived on one
side of the street, I went to this school. Had I lived on the other side of the
street, I would have gone to a different school with kids from families more
like mine. After grade six, these kids and I would go on to the public
intermediate and high school. There was no private school for them or for
me.
<small> dad finally put down the paper. I could tell he was thinking.
“Well, Son…,” he began slowly. “If you want to be rich, you have to
learn to make money.”</small>
“How do I make money?” I asked.
“Well, use your head, Son,” he said, smiling. Even then I knew that
really meant, “That’s all I’m going to tell you,” or “I don’t know the
answer, so don’t embarrass me.”
A Partnership Is Formed
The next morning, I told my best friend, Mike, what my dad had said.
As best as I could tell, Mike and I were the only poor kids in this school.
Mike was also in this school by a twist of fate. Someone had drawn a jog in
the line for the school district, and we wound up in school with the rich
kids. We weren’t really poor, but we felt as if we were because all the other
boys had new baseball gloves, new bicycles, new everything.
Mom and Dad provided us with the basics, like food, shelter, and
clothes. But that was about it. My dad used to say, “If you want something,
work for it.” We wanted things, but there was not much work available for
nine-year-old boys.
“So what do we do to make money?” Mike asked.
“I don’t know,” I said. “But do you want to be my partner?”
He agreed, and so on that Saturday morning, Mike became my first
business partner. We spent all morning coming up with ideas on how to
make money. Occasionally we talked about all the “cool guys” at Jimmy’s
beach house having fun. It hurt a little, but that hurt was good, because it
inspired us to keep thinking of a way to make money. Finally, that
afternoon, a bolt of lightning struck. It was an idea Mike got from a science
book he had read. Excitedly, we shook hands, and the partnership now had
a business.
For the next several weeks, Mike and I ran around our neighborhood,
knocking on doors and asking our neighbors if they would save their
toothpaste tubes for us. With puzzled looks, most adults consented with a
smile. Some asked us what we were doing, to which we replied, “We can’t
tell you. It’s a business secret.”
My mom grew distressed as the weeks wore on. We had selected a site
next to her washing machine as the place we would stockpile our raw
materials. In a brown cardboard box that at one time held catsup bottles, our
little pile of used toothpaste tubes began to grow.
Finally my mom put her foot down. The sight of her neighbors’ messy,
crumpled, used toothpaste tubes had gotten to her. “What are you boys
doing?” she asked. “And I don’t want to hear again that it’s a business
secret. Do something with this mess, or I’m going to throw it out.”
Mike and I pleaded and begged, explaining that we would soon have
enough and then we would begin production. We informed her that we were
waiting on a couple of neighbors to finish their toothpaste so we could have
their tubes. Mom granted us a one-week extension.
The date to begin production was moved up, and the pressure was on.
My first partnership was already being threatened with an eviction notice by
my own mom! It became Mike’s job to tell the neighbors to quickly use up
their toothpaste, saying their dentist wanted them to brush more often
anyway. I began to put together the production line.
One day my dad drove up with a friend to see two nine-year-old boys in
the driveway with a production line operating at full speed. There was fine
white powder everywhere. On a long table were small milk cartons from
school, and our family’s hibachi grill was glowing with red-hot coals at
maximum heat.
<del>dad</del><ins>father</ins> walked up cautiously, having to park the car at the base of the
driveway since the production line blocked the carport. As he and his friend
got closer, they saw a steel pot sitting on top of the coals in which the
toothpaste tubes were being melted down. In those days, toothpaste did not
come in plastic tubes. The tubes were made of lead. So once the paint was
burned off, the tubes were dropped in the small steel pot. They melted until
they became liquid, and with my mom’s pot holders, we poured the lead
through a small hole in the top of the milk cartons.
The milk cartons were filled with plaster of paris. White powder was
everywhere. In my haste, I had knocked the bag over, and the entire area
looked like it had been hit by a snowstorm. The milk cartons were the outer
containers for plaster of paris molds.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;text-decoration: none;color: blue;"> LESSON 2: WHY TEACH FINANCIAL
                LITERACY?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 60px;color: blueviolet;">LESSON 1: THE RICH DON’T WORK
    <p > It’s not how much money you make. It’s how much money you
                keep.
               <strong> In 1990, Mike took over his father’s empire and is, in fact, doing a
                better job than his dad did. We see each other once or twice a year on the
                golf course. He and his wife are wealthier than you could imagine. Rich
                dad’s empire is in great hands, and Mike is now grooming his son to take
                his place, as his dad had groomed us.</strong>
                In 1994, I retired at the age of 47, and my wife Kim was 37. Retirement
                does not mean not working. For us, it means that, barring unforeseen
                cataclysmic changes, we can work or not work, and our wealth grows
                automatically, staying ahead of inflation. Our assets are large enough to
                grow by themselves. It’s like planting a tree. You water it for years, and
                then one day it doesn’t need you anymore. Its roots are implanted deep
                enough. Then the tree provides shade for your enjoyment.
                Mike chose to run the empire, and I chose to retire.
                Whenever I speak to groups of people, they often ask what I would
                recommend that they do. “How do I get started?” “Is there a book you
                would recommend?” “What should I do to prepare my children?” “What is
                your secret to success?” “How do I make millions?”
                Whenever I hear one of these questions, I’m reminded of the following
                story:
                The Richest Businessmen
                In 1923 a group of our greatest leaders and richest businessmen
                held a meeting at the Edgewater Beach hotel in Chicago. Among
                them were Charles Schwab, head of the largest independent steel
                company; Samuel Insull, president of the world’s largest utility;
                Howard Hopson, head of the largest gas company; Ivar Kreuger,
                president of International Match Co., one of the world’s largest
                companies at that time; Leon Frazier, president of the Bank of
                International Settlements; Richard Whitney, president of the New
                York Stock Exchange; Arthur Cotton and Jesse Livermore, two of
                the biggest stock speculators; and Albert Fall, a member of
                President Harding’s cabinet. Twenty-five years later, nine of these
                titans ended their lives as follows: Schwab died penniless after
                living for five years on borrowed money. Insull died broke in a
                foreign land, and Kreuger and Cotton also died broke. Hopson went
                insane. Whitney and Albert Fall were released from prison, and
                Fraser and Livermore committed suicide.
                I doubt if anyone can say what really happened to these men. If you
                look at the date, 1923, it was just before the 1929 market crash and the
                Great Depression, which I suspect had a great impact on these men and
                their lives. The point is this: Today we live in times of greater and faster
                change than these men did. I suspect there will be many booms and busts in
                the coming years that will parallel the ups and downs these men faced. I am
                concerned that too many people are too focused on money and not on their
                greatest wealth, their education. If people are prepared to be flexible, keep
                an open mind and learn, they will grow richer and richer despite tough
                changes. If they think money will solve problems, they will have a rough
                ride. Intelligence solves problems and produces money. Money without
                financial intelligence is money soon gone.
                Most people fail to realize that in life, it’s not how much money you
                make. It’s how much money you keep. We’ve all heard stories of lottery
                winners who are poor, then suddenly rich, and then poor again. They win
                millions, yet are soon back where they started. Or stories of professional
                athletes, who at the age of 24 are earning millions, but are sleeping under a
                bridge 10 years later.
                I remember a story of a young basketball player who a year ago had
                millions. Today, at just 29, he claims his friends, attorney, and accountant
                took his money, and he was forced to work at a car wash for minimum
                wage. He was fired from the car wash because he refused to take off his
                championship ring as he was wiping off the cars. His story made national
                news and he is appealing his termination, claiming hardship and
                discrimination. He claims that the ring is all he has left and if it was
                stripped away, he’ll crumble.
                I know so many people who became instant millionaires. And while I
                am glad some people have become richer and richer, I caution them that in
                the long run, it’s not how much money you make. It’s how much you keep,
                and how many generations you keep it.
                So when people ask, “Where do I get started?” or “Tell me how to get
                rich quick,” they often are greatly disappointed with my answer. I simply
                say to them what my rich dad said to me when I was a little kid. “If you
                want to be rich, you need to be financially literate.”
                That idea was drummed into my head every time we were together. As I
                said, my educated dad stressed the importance of reading books, while my
                rich dad stressed the need to master financial literacy.
                If you are going to build the Empire State Building, the first thing you
                need to do is dig a deep hole and pour a strong foundation. If you are going
                to build a home in the suburbs, all you need to do is pour a six-inch slab of
                concrete. Most people, in their drive to get rich, are trying to build an
                Empire State Building on a six-inch slab.
                Our school system, created in the Agrarian Age, still believes in homes
                with no foundation. Dirt floors are still the rage. So kids graduate from
                school with virtually no financial foundation. One day, sleepless and deep
                in debt in suburbia, living the American Dream, they decide that the answer
                to their financial problems is to find a way to get rich quick.
                Construction on the skyscraper begins. It goes up quickly, and soon,
                instead of the Empire State Building, we have the Leaning Tower of
                Suburbia. The sleepless nights return.
                As for Mike and me in our adult years, both of our choices were
                possible because we were taught to pour a strong financial foundation when
                we were just kids.
                Accounting is possibly the most confusing, boring subject in the world,
                but if you want to be rich long-term, it could be the most important subject.
                For rich dad, the question was how to take a boring and confusing subject
                and teach it to kids. The answer he found was to make it simple by teaching
                it in pictures.
                My rich dad poured a strong financial foundation for Mike and me.
                Since we were just kids, he created a simple way to teach us.
                For years he only drew pictures and used few words. Mike and I
                understood the simple drawings, the jargon, the movement of money, and
                then in later years, rich dad began adding numbers. Today, Mike has gone
                on to master much more complex and sophisticated accounting analysis
                because he had to in order to run his empire. I am not as sophisticated
                because my empire is smaller, yet we come from the same simple
                foundation. Over the following pages, I offer to you the same simple line
                drawings Mike’s dad created for us. Though basic, those drawings helped
                guide two little boys in building great sums of wealth on a solid and deep
                foundation</p>

                    <p>The rich focus on their asset columns while everyone else focuses
                    on their income statements.
                    In 1974, Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald’s, was asked to speak to
                    the MBA class at the University of Texas at Austin. A friend of mine was a
                    student in that MBA class. After a powerful and inspiring talk, the class
                    adjourned and the students asked Ray if he would join them at their favorite
                    hangout to have a few beers. Ray graciously accepted.
                    “What business am I in?” Ray asked, once the group had all their beers
                    in hand.
                    “Everyone laughed,” my friend said. “Most of the MBA students
                    thought Ray was just fooling around.”
                    No one answered, so Ray asked again, “What business do you think I’m
                    in?”
                   <em> The students laughed again, and finally one brave soul yelled out, “Ray,
                    who in the world doesn’t know that you’re in the hamburger business?”
                    Ray chuckled. “That’s what I thought you would say.” He paused and
                    then quickly added, “Ladies and gentlemen, I’m not in the hamburger
                    business. My business is real estate.”</em>
                    As my friend tells the story, Ray spent a good amount of time
                    explaining his viewpoint. In his business plan, Ray knew that the primary
                    business focus was to sell hamburger franchises, but what he never lost
                    sight of was the location of each franchise. He knew that the land and its
                    location were the most significant factors in the success of each franchise.
                    Basically, the person who bought the franchise was also buying the real
                    estate under the franchise for Ray Kroc’s organization.
                    Today, McDonald’s is the largest single owner of real estate in the
                    world, owning even more than the Catholic church. McDonald’s owns some
                    of the most valuable intersections and street corners in America and around
                    the globe.
                    My friend considers this as one of the most important lessons in his life.
                    Today he owns car washes, but his business is the real estate under those car
                    washes.
                    The previous chapter presented diagrams illustrating that most people
                    work for everyone but themselves. They work first for the owners of the
                    company, then for the government through taxes, and finally for the bank
                    that owns their mortgage.
                    When I was a young boy, we did not have a McDonald’s nearby. Yet my
                    rich dad was responsible for teaching Mike and me the same lesson that
                    Ray Kroc talked about at the University of Texas. It is secret number three
                    of the rich. That secret is: Mind your own business. Financial struggle is
                    often directly the result of people working all their lives for someone else.
                    Many people will simply have nothing at the end of their working days to
                    show for their efforts.
                    Our current educational system focuses on preparing today’s youth to
                    get good jobs by developing scholastic skills. Their lives will revolve
                    around their wages or, as described earlier, their income column. Many will
                    study further to become engineers, scientists, cooks, police officers, artists,
                    writers, and so on. These professional skills allow them to enter the
                    workforce and work for money.
                    But there is a big difference between your profession and your business.
                    Often I ask people, “What is your business?” And they will say, “Oh, I’m a
                    banker.” Then I ask them if they own the bank. And they usually respond,
                    “No, I work there.” In that instance, they have confused their profession
                    with their business. Their profession may be a banker, but they still need
                    their own business.
                    A problem with school is that you often become what you study. So if
                    you study cooking, you become a chef. If you study the law, you become an
                    attorney, and a study of auto mechanics makes you a mechanic. The mistake
                    in becoming what you study is that too many people forget to mind their
                    own business. They spend their lives minding someone else’s business and
                    making that person rich.
                    To become financially secure, a person needs to mind their own
                    business. Your business revolves around your asset column, not your
                    income column. As stated earlier, the number-one rule is to know the
                    difference between an asset and a liability, and to buy assets. The rich focus
                    on their asset columns, while everyone else focuses on their income
                    statements.
                    That is why we hear so often: “I need a raise.” “If only I had a
                    promotion.” “I am going back to school to get more training so I can get a
                    better job.” “I am going to work overtime.” “Maybe I can get a second job.”
                    In some circles, these are sensible ideas. But you are still not minding
                    your own business. These ideas all still focus on the income column and
                    will only help a person become more financially secure if the additional
                    money is used to purchase income-generating assets.
                    Financial struggle is often the result of people working all their
                    lives for someone else.
                    The primary reason the majority of the poor and middle class are
                    fiscally conservative—which means, “I can’t afford to take risks”—is that
                    they have no financial foundation. They have to cling to their jobs and play
                    it safe.
                    When downsizing became the “in” thing to do, millions of workers
                    found out their largest so-called asset, their home, was eating them alive.
                    Their “asset” was costing them money every month. Their car, another
                    “asset,” was eating them alive. The golf clubs in the garage that cost $1,000
                    were not worth $1,000 anymore. Without job security, they had nothing to
                    fall back on. What they thought were assets could not help them survive in
                    a time of financial crisis.
                    I assume most of us have filled out a credit application to buy a house or
                    a car. It’s always interesting to look at the “net-worth” section because of
                    what accepted banking and accounting practices allow a person to count as
                    assets.
                    One day when I wanted a loan, my financial position did not look too
                    good. So I added my new golf clubs, my art collection, books, electronics,
                    Armani suits, wristwatches, shoes, and other personal effects to boost the
                    number in the asset column.
                    But I was turned down because I had too much investment real estate.
                    The loan committee didn’t like that I made so much money from rent. They
                    wanted to know why I did not have a normal job with a salary. They did not
                    question the Armani suits, golf clubs, or art collection. Life is sometimes
                    tough when you do not fit the standard profile.
                    I cringe every time I hear someone say to me that their net worth is a
                    million dollars or $100,000 dollars or whatever. One of the main reasons
                    net worth is not accurate is simply because, the moment you begin selling
                    your assets, you are taxed for any gains.
                    So many people have put themselves in deep financial trouble when
                    they run short of income. To raise cash, they sell their assets. But their
                    personal assets can generally be sold for only a fraction of the value that is
                    listed on their personal balance sheet. Or if there is a gain on the sale of the
                    assets, they are taxed on the gain. So again, the government takes its share,
                    thus reducing the amount available to help them out of debt. That is why I
                    say someone’s net worth is often “worth less” than they think.
                    Start minding your own business. Keep your daytime job, but start
                    buying real assets, not liabilities or personal effects that have no real value
                    once you get them home. A new car loses nearly 25 percent of the price you
                    pay for it the moment you drive it off the lot. It is not a true asset even if
                    your banker lets you list it as one. My $400 new titanium driver was worth
                    $150 the moment I teed off.
                    Keep expenses low, reduce liabilities, and diligently build a base of
                    solid assets. For young people who have not yet left home, it is important
                    for parents to teach them the difference between an asset and a liability. Get
                    them to start building a solid asset column before they leave home, get
                    married, buy a house, have kids, and get stuck in a risky financial position,
                    clinging to a job, and buying everything on credit. I see so many young
                    couples who get married and trap themselves into a lifestyle that will not let
                    them get out of debt for most of their working years.
                    For many people, just as the last child leaves home, the parents realize
                    they have not adequately prepared for retirement and they begin to scramble
                    to put some money away. Then their own parents become ill and they find
                    themselves with new responsibilities.
                    So what kind of assets am I suggesting that you or your children
                    acquire? In my world, real assets fall into the following categories:
                    • Businesses that do not require my presence I own them, but they
                    are managed or run by other people. If I have to work there, it’s
                    not a business. It becomes my job.
                    • Stocks
                    • Bonds
                    • Income-generating real estate
                    • Notes (IOUs)
                    • Royalties from intellectual property such as music, scripts, and
                    patents
                    • Anything else that has value, produces income or appreciates,
                    and has a ready market
                    As a young boy, my educated dad encouraged me to find a safe job. But
                    my rich dad encouraged me to begin acquiring assets that I loved. “If you
                    don’t love it, you won’t take care of it.” I collect real estate simply because
                    I love buildings and land. I love shopping for them, and I could look at
                    them all day long. When problems arise, the problems aren’t so bad that it</p>
