                <h1><u>introduction</u></h1>
                <p><b>A year ago, my life had collapsed around me. I'd worked myself
                    into exhaustion, my father died suddenly, and my relationships
                    with my work colleagues and loved ones were in turmoil. Little
                    did I know at the time, out of my greatest despair was to come the
                    greatest gift.</b>
                    I'd been given a glimpse of a Great Secret—The Secret to life. The
                    glimpse came in a hundred-year-old book, given to me by my
                    daughter Hayley. I began tracing The Secret back through history.
                    I couldn't believe all the people who knew this. They were the
                    greatest people in history: Plato, Shakespeare, Newton, Hugo,
                    Beethoven, Lincoln, Emerson, Edison, Einstein.
                    Incredulous, I asked, "Why doesn't everyone know this?" A burning desire to share The Secret with the world consumed me, and I
                    began searching for people alive today who knew The Secret.
                    One by one they began to emerge. I became a magnet: as I began
                    to search, one great living master after another was drawn to me.
                    ix
                    x Foreword
                   <i> When I discovered one teacher, that one would link to the next,
                    in a perfect chain. If I was on the wrong track, something else
                    would catch my attention, and through the diversion the next great
                    teacher would appear. If I "accidentally" pressed the wrong link
                    on an internet search, I would be led to a vital piece of information. In a few short weeks I had traced The Secret back through the
                    centuries, and I had discovered the modern-day practitioners of
                    the Secret.</i>
                    The vision of taking The Secret to the world in a film had become
                    fixed in my mind, and over the following two months my film and
                    television production team learned The Secret. It was imperative
                    that every team member knew it, because without its knowledge,
                    <mark>we were about to attempt would be impossible.
                    We did not have a single teacher secured to film, but we knew The
                    Secret,</mark>  and so with utter faith I flew from Australia to the United
                    States where the majority of the teachers were based. Seven weeks
                    later The Secret team had filmed fifty-five of the greatest teachers
                    across the United States, with over 120 hours of film. With every
                    step, with every breath, we used The Secret to create the The Secret. We literally magnetized everything and everyone to us. Eight
                    months later The Secret was released.
                    As the film swept the world, stories of miracles began to flood in:
                    people wrote about healing from chronic pain, depression, and
                    disease; walking for the first time after an accident; even recovering
                    from a deathbed. We have received thousands of accounts of The Secret being used to bring about large sums of money and unexpected
                    Foreword xi
                   <strong> checks in the mail. People have used The Secret to manifest their
                    perfect homes, life partners, cars, jobs, and promotions, with many
                    accounts of businesses being transformed within days of applying
                    The Secret. </strong>There have been heart-warming stories of stressed relationships involving children being restored to harmony.

            <h1>Foreword</h1>
            <div>BOB PROCTOR
                You've probably been sitting there wondering, "What is The
                Secret?" ill tell you how I've come to understand it.
                We all work with one infinite power. We all guide ourselves
                by exactly the same laws. The natural laws of the universe
                are so precise that we don't even have any difficulty building
                spaceships, we can send people to the moon, and we can time
                the landing with the precision of a fraction of a second.
                Wherever you are—India, Australia, New Zealand,
                Stockholm, London, Toronto, Montreal, or New York—we're
                all working with one power. One Law. It's attraction!
                The Secret Revealed 3
                4 The Secret
                The greatest teachers who have ever lived have told us that the law
                of attraction is the most powerful law in the Universe.
                Poets such as William Shakespeare, Robert Browning, and William
                Blake delivered it in their poetry. Musicians such as Ludwig van
                Beethoven expressed it through their music. Artists such as Leonardo da Vinci depicted it in their paintings. Great thinkers including Socrates, Plato, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Pythagoras, Sir Francis
                Bacon, Sir Isaac Newton, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and Victor
                Hugo shared it in their writings and teachings. Their names have
                been immortalized, and their legendary existence has survived
                centuries.
                Religions, such as Hinduism, Hermetic traditions, Buddhism,
                Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and civilizations, such as the
                ancient Babylonians and Egyptians, delivered it through their writings and stories. Recorded throughout the ages in all its forms, the
                The Secret is the law of attraction!
                Everything that's coming into your life you are attracting
                into your life. And it's attracted to you by virtue of the images
                you're holding in your mind. It's what you're thinking.
                Whatever is going on in your mind you are attracting to you.
                "Every thought of yours is a real thing—a force."
                The Secret Revealed 5
                law can be found in ancient writings through all the centuries. It
                was recorded in stone in 3000 BC. Even though some coveted this
                knowledge, and indeed they did, it has always been there for anyone to discover.
                The law began at the beginning of time. It has always been and will
                always be.
                It is the law that determines the complete order in the Universe,
                every moment of your life, and every single thing you experience
                in your life. It doesn't matter who you are or where you are, the
                law of attraction is forming your entire life experience, and this allpowerful law is doing that through your thoughts. You are the one
                who calls the law of attraction into action, and you do it through
                your thoughts.
                In 1912 Charles Haanel described the law of attraction as "the
                greatest and the most infallible law upon which the entire system
                of creation depends." </div>
